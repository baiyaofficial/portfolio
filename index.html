  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a motivated Business Information Technology graduate with hands-on
    experience in ICT support, web development, and academic systems
    administration. I have worked in fast-paced institutional environments
    where I supported students, lecturers, and administrative staff with
    system access, troubleshooting, and digital solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience includes Moodle LMS installation and management, user
    account administration, technical support, and development of responsive
    websites using Java and Python Django. I am passionate about using
    technology to improve efficiency, simplify processes, and deliver
    reliable user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am continuously learning and currently expanding my skills in JavaScript,
    React, and database-driven systems, with the goal of building scalable
    applications and enterprise-level solutions.
